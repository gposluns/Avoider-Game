# Avoider-Game
an avoider game

This is the oldest project of mine I still have any files for (and not the source, that was only on an old laptop that died).  
This project was created for an English class media assignment, I built the game and a partner I can't remember the full name of provided
the resources (images, etc) and also did a writeup.  The images involved are just things that were on google images I believe.

It's a simple avoider game, which includes instructions.  I used the Allegro C++ library version 5.0.9 to create this.
